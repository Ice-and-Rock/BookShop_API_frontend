- Split into 2 repos âœ…

# Getting start with the BookShop booking system...

This project is split into two repos: <code>frontend</code> and <code>backend</code>. 

Clone BOTH repos into a local folder named "BookShop". Then, in VS code terminal, navigate to the main folder in each repo in two seperate terminal windows and run:

<code>npm install</code>

This will install the projects dependancies from both frontend and backend. It will take a few seconds âœ…

To run the Application and test it for yourself, in the backend terminal folder run:

<code>npm run start</code>

this will start the applications server âœ…

run the same command in the terminal 'frontend' directory. If you are asked to run on another port other than <code>PORT3000</code> select "Y" and press enter. 

this will run the frontend of the application on port:3001 âœ…

In your browser, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
